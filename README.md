- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Grid Layout

### What I Learned

With this project I was able to work on the grid layout and get a further understanding of how to turn a complex web design layout into a more easily and consistent layout through different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

On future projects I will continue to focus on using the CSS Grid layout instead of Flexbox layout in order to excel at both layouts. The CSS Grid layout is a two-dimensional layout that is more complex than Flexbox and learning it will further improve my CSS skills. I will also continue to refine my responsive web design skills in order to execute it in a quicker manner.
